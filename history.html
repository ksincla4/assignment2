            <p style="color: white">Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated, was founded on Wednesday, January 15, 1908 on the campus of Howard Universityâ€”a historically black institution in Washington D.C. The original organization was established by nine college women, including the principle founder Ethel Hedgeman Lyle. Seven sophomores were invited to join in 1908, and these sixteen young women make up the founding group of Alpha Kappa Alpha. In 1913, four women, orchestrated by Nellie Mae Quander, got the organization incorporated to ensure its perpetuity for years to come. Through the efforts of these twenty visionary women, Alpha Kappa Alpha became the <i class="salmonpink">first</i> Greek lettered organization founded by African-American college trained women, and continues to be an international beacon of service to this day.</p>
            <p style="color: white">The Omicron Beta City Chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha was chartered on May 31, 1986 in Rochester, New York. The charter of Omicron Beta encompasses The University of Rochester, Rochester Institute of Technology, Nazareth College, and St. John Fisher College. Omicron Beta continues to serve Rochester after over 30 years, and continues to leave an <i class="applegreen">OUTSTANDING</i> impact on all four campuses and the community! </p>
